# A list of exciting things to do

#Stuff to do in the comfort of home
- How to write css better? reverse engineer the media object in major frameworks
- Lose the jquery, find a small piece of code, no more than five lines currently written in jquery. Write in plain JS.
- Simple little blog. Install a github pages blog in 30 sec. Don't research, just do it for shit and giggles
- APIs are simpler than I thought. Make a super uber simple api that returns my name.
- Draw a single face of a beautiful lady. Extra challenge: can you remember a pattern for this beauty?
- Drawing accuracy: draw two objects's outline with the correct ratio in size. Try different methods of measuring.
- Practice some scales. Sing up and down and try to go higher.
- Breath larger. Explore breathing for 5 minutes, try a larger breath.
- Eyes in to my soul. Move my eyes and make them water, stretch my eyes.
- Clean for 3 minutes. No more than 3 minutes.
- Split up an annoying task into parts, do only 1 part. 
- Go take a nap.
- Go back to the basics: Go do something without technology at all. Practice some handwriting on paper, sing for a bit, draw on a piece of paper, make a bit of food.
- Technology is the future: Go research a hobby project using new technologies. Rent a new camera, print something 3d, buy a movie online, pay for a service/trial
- play with github pages

#Something to read without doing anything
- Knowledge transfer. How does an observable work in objective C, angular? 
- Skin tones FTW: Find a picture of a person's skin, and map the relations of the colours. Guessing is ok.
- HUrray for anatomy: go google a bone, any bone in the body.

#Go out into the world. I know, its far.
- Stretch your glutes. Do it and feel better. Extra challenge: see how the glute muscles work? explore movements.
- Go to the gym for 25 minutes. Do whatever once I'm there.
- Go visit a real bookstore/library.

#For old time sakes, simple pleasures of reminiscing 
- Write something. It's healthy to layout your thoughts.
- Talk to a friend or message a friend for only 5 minutes. Don't do anymore.
