# How to learn about design and language #

Design is complex. The amount of components that goes into design touches on a mindboggling number of fields. How do you reduce that to something more managable? How do distill the essence.

A comparison can be made with other fields. Many artist fields are much simpler in nature. Singing is simpler, being firmly rooted in the abilities of the muscles involved in voice production. Singing is able to use and be shaped by some many movements and muscles.

If it is movements that gives meaning and enables you to learn, then doesn't it make sense that only things that can invoke and involve are good things to learn? The piano advanced to such a degree because of its increasing sophistication in response to human manipulation. The same is true for most other musical instruments.

Indeed, learning, in its purest organic form is without purpose. It does not desire or wish to specialize. Up to my current experience, learning is free. Non-judgemental, neither about things that can make our lives better nor things that makes it worse. 

I have always wondered: If I go back in time to ancient greece, to a time before the discovery of true perspective, would they appreciate a modern realistic painting? I am sure people would be shocked by the realism, by the illusion, but would they find it beautiful? I do not think so. The people wouldn't even have the capability to understand.

Advancements in tools help our mind grasp things. I am sure that before colour paint was abdundant and cheap, colour as a concept did not matter much to a painter. Even primitive colourings would have been beautiful, and the complex sophisticated shades of greys that later dominated victorian paintings would have been completely misunderstood. 

I imagine that organic learning is like a sphere, it extends smoothly and equally in all directions. But life experience, and tools, allow us to focus and have sharp spikes in expertise in certain areas. So wouldn't it make sense that in order to become great in a field like design, one must find the right tools? The right kind of exercises that somehow allows you to get a "spike" in your learning?

 

# Tools shape our thoughts #


A good tool can makes work easy, it can make you more efficent, and is always nice to have. But I think we often overlook another reason for the importance of tools - Our tools shape our thoughts.

Depending on the tools that you are familiar with, this idea may seem either natural to you or simply outrageous. So I'd like to begin this by writing about a few examples that illustrate my point, and then later on in another post, I will talk about the implications of this way of thinking.

## 1. tools are an extension of memory

The more complicated a task is, that harder it is to remember or conceive the all the parts. Take chess for example, if you were to reduce chess only to chess notation, you'd get something that looks like this 

> e4 e5

> Nf3 Nc6

> Bb5 a6

which is close to incomprehensible. However, think of the chess board, and all of a sudden the same moves become filled with rich sensory feedback, more importantly they become easy to understand and to remember. It is probably not fair to use a chessboard as a representation of how other tools influence memory, but it does illustrate the point.

One of the key to having a better memory of something is to know it via multiple senses. An apple is easy to recall because you know it by feel, by taste, by the crunching sound when you bite into it, and by its look and colour.

This process happens with tools more subtly everyday. A photographer's understanding of apertures is enhanced by the clicks and feel of manually dialing the aperture ring. Similarily, this would explain why there is such an obsession by typists on mechanical keyboards.

## 2. tools help us think ##

Composing music does not require many tools. In an simplified world, the composer simply conceives the music and puts it to paper. Indeed, there are people who believe in this exact method of composing - distill music down to its barest essentials, then work on exercising one's mental abilities.

This is true for artists as well. Many people think that a *great* artist simply sees in his mind's eye everything that needs to be done. The *painting* part is simply a way of getting a genius's thoughts on canvas so that others can see. 

I used to believe this...

But sometimes problems and ideas are simply too big to think of, too big to manipulate purely inside one's mind. In practice, composers go to the piano and the simple task of playing it on the keys help tremendously. Artists sketch, make drafts, and using a myriad of tools that helps break big problems in to bite sized tasks. I once heard on the radio an interview with the first violinist of a big orchestra. Before a group of violinists can perform together, somebody, usually the first violinist, has to come up with the bowings. The bowings are the written instructions on how each violinists will use their bow. This done so that all the violinists are in sync or out sync, depending on the needs of the music. In the interview, the violinist said, that most of the time she can do bowing inside her head. But she is only able to do so by imagining a violin inside in her mind. Technically, the idea of synchronizing a group of musicians does not require a tool, but her familiarity with a using a violin helps her tackle this big problem rather easily.

## 3. tools shape our preferences ##

So I've talked about how tools let us remember details, and how they help us conceive and solve big problems. My last example will take about how this all influence our preferences. 

Tools are opinionated; they emphasize certains things while de-emphasizing others. They focus your attention on a small part of the process by making all the other parts easier and more effortless. 

Think of a word processor with its abilities to *undo* and *redo* and *edit* and compare this to the act of writing on paper. The word processer de-emphasizes the need to think ahead of time, because the cost to make changes is so small. On the other hand, writing in pen is practically unchangable, and this forces the writer to think and flesh out his sentence before he commits them to paper. You how these two different tools that perform the same end function, can have a dramatic impact on the creation process. 

This same influence can be seen in just about every other artistic endeavour. In painting, watercolour paints do not layer easily, and it forces the artist to think about and plan out the process of how to apply the paint. There is only one go, and no turning back. 

Oil paints on the other hand is much more forgiving in its ability to layer one paint ontop of a number. However, it takes longer to accomplish the same action and this makes the oil painter focus on long term directions and also how to deal with quick changing enviroments. 

The two tools are fairly similar in what they are trying to accomplish, but the abilities they help develop are very different. This diffence manifests even in the artists's sense of beauty. The watercolourist becomes really capable of finding improvisasional beauty and in the elegance of doing something in one go. Whereas the oil painter, enabled by his slow drying medium, can be much more philosophical and aim to solve long and complicated problems. 


# On complexity

A single movement cannot explain the complexity of learning a task such as playing the piano or becoming accurate with drawing.

# What is good learning

Good learning is about adding information and feedback to a movement. A single movement can always be done with variations and more precision. 

A movement that is not refined is vague and usually includes many feedback that is not relevant to the movement itself. Such as the sensation of skin stretching or the feel of bones moving in a socket. Those are good feedback, but they cannot replace a proper understanding of the movement and its intention.

The result of quality practice and attention makes the myriad of feelings and sensations of a movement more manageable. So one can sort and pay only attention to the essential parts.

There is perhaps no strict hierarchy of which sensation is useful, and which isn't. Constant practice makes a sensation familiar, and less attention is needed to interpret it. In other words, learning is about becoming familiar with existing sensations so that you can pay attention things that are new. It is only by this slow whittling down that one becomes more in command of one's own movements.

# On expertise

Sports people like to say that the expert sees the same things as the beginner, but the difference is that the expert can make sense of what he sees almost unconsciously, while the beginner must make tremendous effort. Painting is the same, it is not any part of painting that makes it difficult, but rather, the difficulty comes from making new thoughts versus remembering past solutions. The expert must resort to remembering, because remembering an answer is always the faster of the two.

This is not to say that there is no value to originality. On the contrary, great things must be original and revelatory. However, to get there, a person should build up more experiences than his rivals. It is the seemingly innocuous details that truly matter.

If learning more about the foundations of our daily movements makes them more meaningful to us, and makes us more capable of distinguishing small but important differences. Then an expert of a certain task is simply someone who also can distinguish more about this task than a normal person. Take for example, the playing of a piano: An expert should find a wealth of meaningful and interesting things in a small detail like the movement of the wrist. A beginner will not perceive or take any real interest, because to him, there is no mental difference between the various ways of moving the wrist.

To extend this further, a good programmer is not someone who knows by memory his programming language/framework the best, but rather someone who can feel and experience the minute details of various implementations.

What does this mean for the learning something like design? Design theory is inherently too broad to focus on smaller details. So what ends up shaping the designer's thoughts are the expertise he picked up in order to *produce* his designs. A designer that uses wood as his material becomes familiar to the details and differences that are part of the process of working with wood - the direction of the wood, the moisture…etc. Being able to recognize these details allows him to make better wood works but it also shapes his aesthetics. He might find a piece of wood beautiful because of the rarity of the patterns of the grain. He might also find a piece of work beautiful because he can see the economy and efficiency of the woodworker from the tool marks. However, the important thing here is that the designer finds beauty in the "craft" part of his work, and this is a type of beauty that is *not* shared by the general public. The general public, having not learned woodworking, sees none of the small details, and find the result worthless.

How to solve this problem? 

One way has been to educate the viewer. There are many places where this has worked to good effect. The beauty of classical music is lost on untrained ears, but it also means that its lovers had to learn to appreciate the music. We also see the appreciation for good typography slowly permeating the masses, as companies like apple use marketing to educate the public on the greatness of their product. What about the relentless pursuit of processing speeds of CPUs? 10 years ago a person would have waited 5~10 seconds for a webpage to load, but thru the gradual upgrade process, the users find meaningful differences in smaller and smaller timeframes. What used to be perfectly fine is now unthinkable.

Another way is to step in the shoes of the viewer, and find out what matters to him/her. This way is fraught with dangers because the viewpoint of the average public is just that - _average_. Companies and designers that use this way of thinking routinely end up with mediocrity or worse. The proliferation of utter shit probably exist in part because the person in charge could not tell the difference between good or bad.

What is my current solution? I feel that a designer should be able to choose which area he becomes intimately familiar with. The ideal should be to *create* a tool that provides rich feedback for just the area he wishes to emphasize. This way, he gets the deep depth of meaning that comes with intimacy with tools, but also shaped so that it matches what matters with the consumer.

But creating a tool is breathtakingly hard...
