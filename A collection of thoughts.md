# A journal of my thoughts

# Happiness and life decisions #

Lately, I have faced many life decisions, such as the almost breakup between tiffany and I, to get a job or not, to go to japan or not.

I have been really struggling with my internal ideas of what will make me happy versus what are simply my comfort zone and habits. Often times, I don't know whether I hesistant because of what is good, or because I am simply outside of my comfort zone.

I feel so lost at times. So sad at times. Yet so profoundly inspired, happy, and fulfilled.

Life is a mystery, and I think I'm getting happier.



# What tiffany says and how I feel #

How do I feel? Why?

sad. I seem to be easily sad, not depressed, just sad. 

I think how I deal with people is based on their words, facial expressions? Perhaps its means its more of a substitute for real true empathy, but its my current state of being.

Words weigh heavily in my mind, it lingers, emotions. 

but is this true? 

# thought and movement  #

It seems like my efforts in refining my UX thinking has been paying off. There is structure to learning about thoughts as well. Whether this has my years of learning about movement to thank, I don't know. Nor do I know the hierarchy between thought and movement. But learning is afoot.

To refine thinking: make small changes in the least effortful way as possible. find an effortless thought.

to refine movement: repeat single movement, gradually reducing effort. direct attention to movement.

# life direction  #

Where to?

I have make choices. Constantly. But this one is big.

To stay is to gamble with my time, happiness, and opportunities for something in the future, a distant goal of money. There might be other opportunities that pop up, but such things is no imaginable, and certainly nothing to act on.

To leave is to have freedom. But freedom cannot buy happiness. Learning can, doing can, but freedom alone cannot. Because it does not give meaning. Struggles do, discoveries do.

Leaving means I can work on my own projects. But I don't have the expertise to do anything I want. Realistically, I can't learn it in any reasonable amount of time. Also, the enviroment I cultivate will change me, freedom now means my enviroment will be mostly one of solitude. No money means severe restrictions.

So what will give me greater happiness? To quit or not to quit? Maybe the impact is smaller than I can imagine. To learn is the most important one, to learn, and learn, and learn.

Am I learning enough? No. What will make the biggest impact on my learning? 

- rent place of my own
- go enroll in a school
- join another startup
- start small, work towards my goals?

# learning thinking  #

The most rewarding thing I've ever discovered is to learn about movement. Movement underlies everything, or so I thought.

Lately, I've come to the realization that one can learn about how to improve thinking, not thru the ways of hypnotism that I learned before, but rather thru a way that is inspired by my lessons in movement.

The biggest idea when I learn movement is that I am starting with the smallest building block - the single movement. Each time I stumble upon a theory, there is always a driving force towards the root cause. This has rewarded me greatly, but it does not explain everything.

In fact, I am starting to suspect that my learning was not towards one single root cause, but rather learning revolving around one single set of ideas. The ideas change of course, my need to improve sees to it. Nonetheless, perhaps there is more to learning, about movement, and about thinking, than I previously ever imagined.

I must accept two fundamental truths: I am not special, and I can't learn everything. I used to believe that thru sheer luck, or god's fortune, I stumbled upon the one important thing that would enable everything else. Perhaps this still is somewhat true, learning about movement has been the key to everything, but if I am to see the potential of this through, I must give up on the thought that I am special in any way.

Yes this means that I must research, work harder, think harder. It also means that someone else might have a better idea than mine. I know not what what my learnings yield, I do know what this confession bring.

# designer happiness  #

How to be happy as a designer? What kind of tasks feel continously rewarding, and what kind of tasks drains your soul?

There is a kind of task that feels like learning. It is frustrating, difficult to motivate, requires a tremendous amount of thinking. But it is at the end of these tasks that there is a great sense of accomplishment, of liberation, and full of possibilities. 

On the other hand, there are tasks that simply draws upon past decisions. It feels easy to start, misleadingly simple, and ultimately fairly unrewarding.

Neither of these kinds of feelings says anything about the quality of the end result. After all, reusing past decisions is safe, speedy, and guarrantees a certain level of success.

But that is not the question I am concerned with. Happiness is of the most importance, and to design in a way the creates sustainable source of happiness, that is the real gold.

# design process #

I think designing UI is about getting all the components of design inside my mind. Then make changes to one aspect and watch how that affects everything else.

If I were to formalize this process, it would be:

1. forcibly consider the permutations of user motivation, effort, interaction process, conventions, visual style, etc

2. try to combine them into a whole. analyze the result from every aspect.

3. Reduce idea to its core. and repeat.

# a framework for learning movement  #

Over the years, I notice patterns in how I learn about movements. Each time a breakthru is made, it is made in one of the following areas:

1. direction of movement
2. feeling of attention, focus.
3. phases of movement, tension vs. relaxation
4. distance of each small step, large vs. micro
5. combination of multiple movements
6. starting points.

Since my views on learning about movements is changing, and it is slowly moving away from the "one and only holy grail". My mind is free to think about the structure of movement learning and to see if one can come up with tools. 

# Habits #

Learning is no longer a narrow set of activities for me. My theories have also expanded. So more and more, I have been focusing on refining the habits and methods of learning itself. 

Ideally, I would like to be able to spend hours a day learning and to do so as efficently and as pleasurably as possible. Before, I clinged to the naive hope that as learning improves, it will improve itself. This was true to some extent but it quickly plateaued. I have been learning for roughly the same amount of time each day, and fall to the same kind of procrastination as I had for the past couple of years.

So lately, I've taken to analyzing the habits that surround learning and try and make some changes. 

> try to focus on doing learning first.

This habit is smaller and more precise than my habit of "do enough learning for a day". I find that focusing on doing learning first is alot easier to do and to maintain than what I've done before. 

Speaking of prioritizing things. I find that to my current mind, only first and second, or now and later, is meaningful. Scheduling something to be done in the 3rd place or after is meaningless and weak. It is incredibly easy to procrastinate or switch up the order.

Here's a thought: habits are also things that can be learned. If this is true, then how do I get started? Habits are seemlingly shapeless and have no roots in anything close to physical movements. If I can learn *better* about habits, then I can do something interesting about shaping my life.

# Learning design #

I have been working on design every day for the past month. Working hard on design and the learning i've been doing is different from things i've learned in the past.

Before, when I learned painting, it was always about trying and experimenting with ideas i've read in books or following instructions from tutorials/web/teacher. Doing design is the first time when I applied some of my new theories of learning phyiscal movements to learning something psychological/mental. 

There are two things that define this new way of learning: 

1. break down into component pieces and think about how every connects. 
2. invent my own tools/methods.

The result of these two new habits is that learning and doing design is alot more fulfilling than when I learnt painting. But it also casts in doubt my theories about the hierarchy of learning. My theory states that learning phyiscal movements is at a more fundamental level and all learning builds from that point up. So to learn something psychological, I would have to learn the movements responsible, combine the movements in interesting ways, and finally change my thinking.

Instead, a alternative theory is born. Learning about physical movements does not directly relate to mental learnings. They are instead metaphors we build our thoughts upon. Therefore, to learn drawing, one does not need to spend all the energy in mastering the movements of the finger. it is the metaphors, not the direct connections, that matter.

Thinking about it like this is liberating: it has the potential to better explain the complex mental abilities we possesses. But it also means that there is no magic pill, that mastery of any physical movement does not translate into mental intelligence.

A theory of metaphors has its own merits. This means that mastery of physical movements can have benefits in seemingly unrelated fields. It also improves speed of learning because I do not have to start everything from scratch.

Time will tell...

## hierarchy of learning ##

I used to think that learning had a hierarchy, certain skills are more fundamental, while others are more shallow. Learning drawing can be thought of as more pure than photography. The first is about mastering how to express the mind, while the latter is more about how to use and manipulate a piece of artifical equipment.

So following that line of thought, one should learn fundamental skills versus learning shallow ones, because if one is good at drawing, one becomes automatically better at photography.

Lately, I began to doubt this. I tried to do a bit more photography and I found myself learning new thoughts and processes that focused on different things. So while photography is more instant and automatic, versus painting everything stroke by stroke, instead of becoming a more automated task, it simply focuses the learning on something else instead.

But how do I explain the many skills that do not become "artist" pursuits, things such as painting walls, polishing shoes, etc. After all, these things might have a learning curve as well. Does this mean that these takes are equally worthy of attention?

I think what really matter isn't what is being learned, but rather, the depth of the learning. Certain things have an audience that appreciate years of practice, whereas others have a much less strict.Only when the feedback loop of a proper enviroment and a proper learning attitude exist together does learning a skill becomes more art than necessity. 

What about my learning of movements then? It doesnt have an audience. I think that is the saddest part. Chances are, if there exists a community that truly appreciates learning about basics, then I would be learning and performing at a much higher level. Currently, I am simply "hi-jackin" other enviroments. Find an enviroment where deep learning can give a competitive advantage and do that. But that will not always be the best solution.

There is also another idea, that a community is only worth so much. That eventually, and sooner than later, an artist must set free and work on his individual works. Depth is at once meaning but also isolating.






# How to learn about design and language #

Design is complex. The amount of components that goes into design touches on a mindboggling number of fields. How do you reduce that to something more managable? How do distill the essence.

A comparison can be made with other fields. Many artist fields are much simpler in nature. Singing is simpler, being firmly rooted in the abilities of the muscles involved in voice production. Singing is able to use and be shaped by some many movements and muscles.

If it is movements that gives meaning and enables you to learn, then doesn't it make sense that only things that can invoke and involve are good things to learn? The piano advanced to such a degree because of its increasing sophistication in response to human manipulation. The same is true for most other musical instruments.

Indeed, learning, in its purest organic form is without purpose. It does not desire or wish to specialize. Up to my current experience, learning is free. Non-judgemental, neither about things that can make our lives better nor things that makes it worse. 

I have always wondered: If I go back in time to ancient greece, to a time before the discovery of true perspective, would they appreciate a modern realistic painting? I am sure people would be shocked by the realism, by the illusion, but would they find it beautiful? I do not think so. The people wouldn't even have the capability to understand.

Advancements in tools help our mind grasp things. I am sure that before colour paint was abdundant and cheap, colour as a concept did not matter much to a painter. Even primitive colourings would have been beautiful, and the complex sophisticated shades of greys that later dominated victorian paintings would have been completely misunderstood. 

I imagine that organic learning is like a sphere, it extends smoothly and equally in all directions. But life experience, and tools, allow us to focus and have sharp spikes in expertise in certain areas. So wouldn't it make sense that in order to become great in a field like design, one must find the right tools? The right kind of exercises that somehow allows you to get a "spike" in your learning?

# Elements of design #

How to approach learning design? It is diverse, expansive, and broad reaching. Design involves so many and affects so much. Traditionally, design is reduced to a framework. Perhaps it is some set of principals, or maybe it is reduced to visual categories. More often than not, these things are steeped in history, and shaped by the professions.

All of these are great and helpful. They let you analyze design, they give you things to talk about, even a way to plot new directions. But what is lacking is a framework that has learning at its center.

Here's what I think the elements of design should be in a framework that was all about learning design and how to get better at design.

1. Mathematical ratios and the system of grids.

In order to chunk down design into more manageable sizes, my first "chunk" would be something that can express and explain many of the variations in 2d design. More importantly, it has to be something that is a good measure of design ability.

The theory of composition and ratios are a good fit. For one, they can be expressed simply into numbers. Two, one can measure your knowledge of grids, not just by theory but through practical tests. Example, [     __  ] what is the ratio of the white space between either side of the underscore? 

Ratios and spaces can be remembered. One can learn to know what 3:2 looks like or 16:9 or 1:10. The intuitive understanding of ratios is a good way to measure your learning progress of visual design.

2. Perception of depth

I don't like to think of perspective as one major element of design. This is because many of the ways to express depth is not at all involved with how things receed into the distance. Shadows, overlapping edges, highlights and colours can often give the illusion of depth even while violating the rules of perspective. 

More importantly, depth is not "visual". To learn depth, one must associate it with the feeling of movement. In and out of space. Even though visual arts don't need to distinguish between up down left and right, as it is all relative to the viewpoint of perspective, in practice, how people feels in relation to your design is vital. Is it a top down feeling? or a forward back feeling? We intuitvely understand up and down. In and out.

3. Texture

I think this is important, but I don't know much about it. I'm just putting it here for now.

# How to learn complex tasks - writing and speaking #

How do you learn language? What is it that makes a good writer? Speaker? What is it that made the writers and speakers of the past so great, and the modern so medicore?

One thing I can wrap my mind around is rhyme. Rhyme is at the heart of language, it means paying attention to the movements of the mouth and the breath. Rhyme means to match movements that are nested in others, rhyme gives feedback, it give cadence to language.

I think one of the essential skills in great language ability, is the ability to rhyme.

# How to learn complex tasks - colours for painting? #

I think what gives me great colours control is having done the colour charts back in CAFA days. For those who don't know, a colour chart is made by mixing every possible permutations of the combination of your pallete. 

Perhaps a way to understand light better is to do a colour chart but instead of mixing, using RGB?

food for thought. 


# Tools shape our thoughts #


A good tool can makes work easy, it can make you more efficent, and is always nice to have. But I think we often overlook another reason for the importance of tools - Our tools shape our thoughts.

Depending on the tools that you are familiar with, this idea may seem either natural to you or simply outrageous. So I'd like to begin this by writing about a few examples that illustrate my point, and then later on in another post, I will talk about the implications of this way of thinking.

## 1. tools are an extension of memory

The more complicated a task is, that harder it is to remember or conceive the all the parts. Take chess for example, if you were to reduce chess only to chess notation, you'd get something that looks like this 

> e4 e5

> Nf3 Nc6

> Bb5 a6

which is close to incomprehensible. However, think of the chess board, and all of a sudden the same moves become filled with rich sensory feedback, more importantly they become easy to understand and to remember. It is probably not fair to use a chessboard as a representation of how other tools influence memory, but it does illustrate the point.

One of the key to having a better memory of something is to know it via multiple senses. An apple is easy to recall because you know it by feel, by taste, by the crunching sound when you bite into it, and by its look and colour.

This process happens with tools more subtly everyday. A photographer's understanding of apertures is enhanced by the clicks and feel of manually dialing the aperture ring. Similarily, this would explain why there is such an obsession by typists on mechanical keyboards.

## 2. tools help us think ##

Composing music does not require many tools. In an simplified world, the composer simply conceives the music and puts it to paper. Indeed, there are people who believe in this exact method of composing - distill music down to its barest essentials, then work on exercising one's mental abilities.

This is true for artists as well. Many people think that a *great* artist simply sees in his mind's eye everything that needs to be done. The *painting* part is simply a way of getting a genius's thoughts on canvas so that others can see. 

I used to believe this...

But sometimes problems and ideas are simply too big to think of, too big to manipulate purely inside one's mind. In practice, composers go to the piano and the simple task of playing it on the keys help tremendously. Artists sketch, make drafts, and using a myriad of tools that helps break big problems in to bite sized tasks. I once heard on the radio an interview with the first violinist of a big orchestra. Before a group of violinists can perform together, somebody, usually the first violinist, has to come up with the bowings. The bowings are the written instructions on how each violinists will use their bow. This done so that all the violinists are in sync or out sync, depending on the needs of the music. In the interview, the violinist said, that most of the time she can do bowing inside her head. But she is only able to do so by imagining a violin inside in her mind. Technically, the idea of synchronizing a group of musicians does not require a tool, but her familiarity with a using a violin helps her tackle this big problem rather easily.

## 3. tools shape our preferences ##

So I've talked about how tools let us remember details, and how they help us conceive and solve big problems. My last example will take about how this all influence our preferences. 

Tools are opinionated; they emphasize certains things while de-emphasizing others. They focus your attention on a small part of the process by making all the other parts easier and more effortless. 

Think of a word processor with its abilities to *undo* and *redo* and *edit* and compare this to the act of writing on paper. The word processer de-emphasizes the need to think ahead of time, because the cost to make changes is so small. On the other hand, writing in pen is practically unchangable, and this forces the writer to think and flesh out his sentence before he commits them to paper. You how these two different tools that perform the same end function, can have a dramatic impact on the creation process. 

This same influence can be seen in just about every other artistic endeavour. In painting, watercolour paints do not layer easily, and it forces the artist to think about and plan out the process of how to apply the paint. There is only one go, and no turning back. 

Oil paints on the other hand is much more forgiving in its ability to layer one paint ontop of a number. However, it takes longer to accomplish the same action and this makes the oil painter focus on long term directions and also how to deal with quick changing enviroments. 

The two tools are fairly similar in what they are trying to accomplish, but the abilities they help develop are very different. This diffence manifests even in the artists's sense of beauty. The watercolourist becomes really capable of finding improvisasional beauty and in the elegance of doing something in one go. Whereas the oil painter, enabled by his slow drying medium, can be much more philosophical and aim to solve long and complicated problems. 


# On complexity

A single movement cannot explain the complexity of learning a task such as playing the piano or becoming accurate with drawing.

# What is good learning

Good learning is about adding information and feedback to a movement. A single movement can always be done with variations and more precision. 

A movement that is not refined is vague and usually includes many feedback that is not relevant to the movement itself. Such as the sensation of skin stretching or the feel of bones moving in a socket. Those are good feedback, but they cannot replace a proper understanding of the movement and its intention.

The result of quality practice and attention makes the myriad of feelings and sensations of a movement more manageable. So one can sort and pay only attention to the essential parts.

There is perhaps no strict hierarchy of which sensation is useful, and which isn't. Constant practice makes a sensation familiar, and less attention is needed to interpret it. In other words, learning is about becoming familiar with existing sensations so that you can pay attention things that are new. It is only by this slow whittling down that one becomes more in command of one's own movements.

# On expertise

Sports people like to say that the expert sees the same things as the beginner, but the difference is that the expert can make sense of what he sees almost unconsciously, while the beginner must make tremendous effort. Painting is the same, it is not any part of painting that makes it difficult, but rather, the difficulty comes from making new thoughts versus remembering past solutions. The expert must resort to remembering, because remembering an answer is always the faster of the two.

This is not to say that there is no value to originality. On the contrary, great things must be original and revelatory. However, to get there, a person should build up more experiences than his rivals. It is the seemingly innocuous details that truly matter.

If learning more about the foundations of our daily movements makes them more meaningful to us, and makes us more capable of distinguishing small but important differences. Then an expert of a certain task is simply someone who also can distinguish more about this task than a normal person. Take for example, the playing of a piano: An expert should find a wealth of meaningful and interesting things in a small detail like the movement of the wrist. A beginner will not perceive or take any real interest, because to him, there is no mental difference between the various ways of moving the wrist.

To extend this further, a good programmer is not someone who knows by memory his programming language/framework the best, but rather someone who can feel and experience the minute details of various implementations.

What does this mean for the learning something like design? Design theory is inherently too broad to focus on smaller details. So what ends up shaping the designer's thoughts are the expertise he picked up in order to *produce* his designs. A designer that uses wood as his material becomes familiar to the details and differences that are part of the process of working with wood - the direction of the wood, the moisture…etc. Being able to recognize these details allows him to make better wood works but it also shapes his aesthetics. He might find a piece of wood beautiful because of the rarity of the patterns of the grain. He might also find a piece of work beautiful because he can see the economy and efficiency of the woodworker from the tool marks. However, the important thing here is that the designer finds beauty in the "craft" part of his work, and this is a type of beauty that is *not* shared by the general public. The general public, having not learned woodworking, sees none of the small details, and find the result worthless.

How to solve this problem? 

One way has been to educate the viewer. There are many places where this has worked to good effect. The beauty of classical music is lost on untrained ears, but it also means that its lovers had to learn to appreciate the music. We also see the appreciation for good typography slowly permeating the masses, as companies like apple use marketing to educate the public on the greatness of their product. What about the relentless pursuit of processing speeds of CPUs? 10 years ago a person would have waited 5~10 seconds for a webpage to load, but thru the gradual upgrade process, the users find meaningful differences in smaller and smaller timeframes. What used to be perfectly fine is now unthinkable.

Another way is to step in the shoes of the viewer, and find out what matters to him/her. This way is fraught with dangers because the viewpoint of the average public is just that - _average_. Companies and designers that use this way of thinking routinely end up with mediocrity or worse. The proliferation of utter shit probably exist in part because the person in charge could not tell the difference between good or bad.

What is my current solution? I feel that a designer should be able to choose which area he becomes intimately familiar with. The ideal should be to *create* a tool that provides rich feedback for just the area he wishes to emphasize. This way, he gets the deep depth of meaning that comes with intimacy with tools, but also shaped so that it matches what matters with the consumer.

But creating a tool is breathtakingly hard...
