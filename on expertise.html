    <h1> A journal of my thoughts and experiments on learning</h1>

<h1> My current routine</h1>

<p>Pay attention to the distribution of feedback for a movement. Divide a movement into three parts: the beginning, middle, and end. Based on sensor feedback, do you expect the beginning to equal the middle and equal the end?</p>

<p>Although that might be the mental model for most people, the trust is very different. There is a tremendous amount of feedback to do the first part, while the feedback grow less and less. So in the bending of an arm, the first 70% of the distance belongs to the first part, because of the sensor richness. The middle part moves the arm only 20%. While the last part only moves 10%.</p>

<p>To put this another way, the feeling of effort is inverse to the perceived feedback. By dividing effort equally into three stages, one gets a 70, 20, 10 distribution of sensor feedback. </p>

<p>Previously, I paid attention to the smallest physical distance a movement can make in the beginning. Trying to match that sensation to a location on the body was not good enough. </p>

<p>Now I am paying attention the phyisical distance traveled by the first stage of effort, and using that rich sensory feedback to locate the position.</p>

<h1> <em>The theory:</em></h1>

<h1> On complexity</h1>

<p>A single movement cannot explain the complexity of learning a task such as playing the piano or becoming accurate with drawing.</p>

<h1> What is good learning</h1>

<p>Good learning is about adding information and feedback to a movement. A single movement can always be done with variations and more precision. </p>

<p>A movement that is not refined is vague and usually includes many feedback that is not relevant to the movement itself. Such as the sensation of skin stretching or the feel of bones moving in a socket. Those are good feedback, but they cannot replace a proper understanding of the movement and its intention.</p>

<p>The result of quality practice and attention makes the myriad of feelings and sensations of a movement more manageable. So one can sort and pay only attention to the essential parts.</p>

<p>There is perhaps no strict hierarchy of which sensation is useful, and which isn't. Constant practice makes a sensation familiar, and less attention is needed to interpret it. In other words, learning is about becoming familiar with existing sensations so that you can pay attention things that are new. It is only by this slow whittling down that one becomes more in command of one's own movements.</p>

<h1> On expertise</h1>

<p>Sports people like to say that the expert sees the same things as the beginner, but the difference is that the expert can make sense of what he sees almost unconsciously, while the beginner must make tremendous effort. Painting is the same, it is not any part of painting that makes it difficult, but rather, the difficulty comes from making new thoughts versus remembering past solutions. The expert must resort to remembering, because remembering an answer is always the faster of the two.</p>

<p>This is not to say that there is no value to originality. On the contrary, great things must be original and revelatory. However, to get there, a person should build up more experiences than his rivals. It is the seemingly innocuous details that truly matter.</p>

<p>If learning more about the foundations of our daily movements makes them more meaningful to us, and makes us more capable of distinguishing small but important differences. Then an expert of a certain task is simply someone who also can distinguish more about this task than a normal person. Take for example, the playing of a piano: An expert should find a wealth of meaningful and interesting things in a small detail like the movement of the wrist. A beginner will not perceive or take any real interest, because to him, there is no mental difference between the various ways of moving the wrist.</p>

<p>To extend this further, a good programmer is not someone who knows by memory his programming language/framework the best, but rather someone who can feel and experience the minute details of various implementations.</p>

<p>What does this mean for the learning something like design? Design theory is inherently too broad to focus on smaller details. So what ends up shaping the designer's thoughts are the expertise he picked up in order to <em>produce</em> his designs. A designer that uses wood as his material becomes familiar to the details and differences that are part of the process of working with wood - the direction of the wood, the moistureâ€¦etc. Being able to recognize these details allows him to make better wood works but it also shapes his aesthetics. He might find a piece of wood beautiful because of the rarity of the patterns of the grain. He might also find a piece of work beautiful because he can see the economy and efficiency of the woodworker from the tool marks. However, the important thing here is that the designer finds beauty in the "craft" part of his work, and this is a type of beauty that is <em>not</em> shared by the general public. The general public, having not learned woodworking, sees none of the small details, and find the result worthless.</p>

<p>How to solve this problem? </p>

<p>One way has been to educate the viewer. There are many places where this has worked to good effect. The beauty of classical music is lost on untrained ears, but it also means that its lovers had to learn to appreciate the music. We also see the appreciation for good typography slowly permeating the masses, as companies like apple use marketing to educate the public on the greatness of their product. What about the relentless pursuit of processing speeds of CPUs? 10 years ago a person would have waited 5~10 seconds for a webpage to load, but thru the gradual upgrade process, the users find meaningful differences in smaller and smaller timeframes. What used to be perfectly fine is now unthinkable.</p>

<p>Another way is to step in the shoes of the viewer, and find out what matters to him/her. This way is fraught with dangers because the viewpoint of the average public is just that - <em>average</em>. Companies and designers that use this way of thinking routinely end up with mediocrity or worse. The proliferation of utter shit probably exist in part because the person in charge could not tell the difference between good or bad.</p>

<p>What is my current solution? I feel that a designer should be able to choose which area he becomes intimately familiar with. The ideal should be to <em>create</em> a tool that provides rich feedback for just the area he wishes to emphasize. This way, he gets the deep depth of meaning that comes with intimacy with tools, but also shaped so that it matches what matters with the consumer.</p>

<p>But creating a tool is breathtakingly hard...</p>
