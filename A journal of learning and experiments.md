# A journal of my experiments on learning

# Current routine - pay attention to large distances in proportion to effort:

Pay attention to the distribution of feedback for a movement. Divide a movement into three parts: the beginning, middle, and end. Based on sensor feedback, do you expect the beginning to equal the middle and equal the end?

Although that might be the mental model for most people, the truth is very different. There is a tremendous amount of feedback for the first part, and the growing progressively less and less as effort increases. So in the bending of an arm, the first 70% of the distance belongs to the first part, because of the sensory richness. The middle part moves the arm only 20%. While the last part only moves 10%.

To put this another way, the feeling of effort is the inverse of the perceived feedback. By dividing effort equally into three stages, one gets a 70, 20, 10 distribution of the movement.

Previously, I paid attention to the smallest physical distance a movement can make in the beginning. Trying to match that sensation to a location on the body was not good enough. 

Now I am paying attention the phyisical distance traveled by the first stage of effort, and using that rich sensory feedback to locate the position.

This routine brings to focus the large movements for the first time. Movements such as bending a leg or an arm used to be incomprehensible. Because by only moving in small increments, the huge distance covered in larger movements meant that there was 20-30 small increments. There was no discernable pattern to how those small increments change. I now realize that the small increments was possible due to a combination of muscle movements and did no reflect that actual essential muscles used in a movement.

## Pay attention to the pattern of effort:

Pay attention to the pattern of effort for a movement. The pattern is the beginning of a movement is easy and provides an effortless feeling. Then it becomes harder to move. Finally, it is difficult. 

By matching this pattesrn of effort to the study of movement, I find that I can eliminate a lot of areas to look at because they do not match. The reason they do not match is probably because it was caused by two or more muscles moving at once rather than an essential muscle movement.

## Pay attention to the sensation of joints:

Bones and joints are good indicators of movements. Often movements are about rotating around a certain joints. Thinking about joints allows me to focus on the direction of a movement. Does the movement go forward or backward, left and right? or up and down? Certain movements that might easily be thought of a moving up and down, such as the straighting of the spine, might actually be a movement of a muscule pulling forward and backward in space, shifting the spine closer towards the front of the rib cage or farther away.

## Pay attention to the relaxation

Pay attention to the way the muscles feel when relaxing. There should be a tangible feeling of relaxation and not just a slow incremental change in position. This tangible feeling of relaxation allows one to filter out the feeling of the movement versus the noise of the other bone/skin/other muscle sensations.
