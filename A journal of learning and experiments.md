# learning about movement and the effect on intelligence  #

I have always thought that eventually, learning thru movement will have an effect on intelligence. Originally, I thought that it would make memory easier, make visualization clearer and better, and other things generally related to the normal concept of smartness - That is, someone that can respond faster, recall more, and make many associations.

I had always knew that this was likely to be a poor model of intelligence, and that the actual improvements would likely to be broader and less...directly... applicable. 

Today, my I had a new revelation. Learning *does* indeed affect intelligence, but in a completely unexpected way. What learning does is give a physical representation of abstract ideas. Ideas such as maps, mental direction, paradigms and models. These are common tools used in just about every field of endeavour. However, like always, the solution is in plain sight. Greater intelligence does not simply mean a difference in specific feats of mental ability, rather, intelligence seem to be about being better able to conceive and apply different models of thinking. 

I know this is not a novel concept, or even an attractive one. For one, this means that a smart person is not inherently better at doing something than another. He probably doesn't even learn faster, but he learns more concretely. He has more *physical* memories, and mental understandings to draw upon. 

No abstract idea is truly abstract. Everything must be conceived by the human mind. No conception is passive, everything begins with an intention. In this way, learning about the intentions of movement doesnt directly translate into greater abilities, but it does translate in how one perceives new thoughts. __That__ is why a painter can be near-sighted and still be great, why a musician can be loosing his physical agility but still be awe-inspiring. 

The learning of a specific thing is always specific. It does not translate into another learning. Painting is simply painting, piano is just piano. There is probably no magic that can allow one to learn everything without actually learning everything. The magic is in how fast we learn, and more importantly, how concretely we learn. The conrete thought is easier to remember, and better for thinking. 

# The direction of a single movement. #

Direction does not naturally exist. There is the unconscious feeling of gravity, and equilibrium, but actual direction is a learned thing. Think of the airplane pilots that mistakes the ocean for the sky and you'll understand what I mean.

So what is our sense of direction? How do we tell up from down, left from right? I think every movement has its own direction, a path of travel. Often, it is an oval path, such as movements using your joints, and your spine. It is only when you have multiple movements together, that you achieve the understanding of left, right, up and down. In otherwords, directions as we know it are largely an abstract concept derived from how we utilize every fiber of our being. 

Although this works most of the time, it does fail whenever precision is required. Try drawing a straight line on paper, and you will find that unless you have had training, it is nearly impossible. Any attempt to correct the mistakes actually results in worse and more crooked lines. Just like walking on a high tension wire, or trying to balance on a single point. Conscious effort will inadvertently result in failure.

Our understanding of the paths that each movement makes is actually very rough. But this is not a bad thing, because we learn in chunks. We start from learning how *groups* of movements work together, instead of building things from parts. This gives us the ability to quickly pick up some skill and do it at an entry level. But this also means that to do something at a *high level*, every part of the understanding must become richer and be rexamined. A straight line is made out of many piece of a circle acting counter to each other - standing upright is about balancing the opposing forces of the muscles of our backs, legs, and stomechs.

Knowing this will also shed light on our understanding of thinking. It is easy to think of the world as opposites: if so and so is bad, the opposite must be trust. If going in this direction is wrong, go in that direction. Subtly, our awareness of movement, and space, affects how we understand concepts. Something is never actually the opposite of something else. The solution usually does not lie in the opposite direction. To understand a world of *linear thinking*, smart people intuitively tries to break it down into other models. 

Just today, I am reading about good user interface design. A book mentions how all sorts of designs fail, and if one simple does the opposite, one would make good design. Am I too naive to think that focusing on what works is a better paradigm? Is what I'm suggesting simply yet another reaction to direction of things? unfortunately, the answer is probably yes.

You are not aware of what makes up things until you experience them. 

#Isolate a single movement. #

Motivation for doing learning seems to be based upon the emphasis of a single movement sensation. Switching between different movement group takes mental effort and eventually becomes tiring.

This time, pay attention to the feeling of a single movement. Now that I've learned to judge movements in larger distances and in proportion, it's become much easier to isolate one "true" movement. To improve, simple extend the movement further in its range of motion thru relaxation and thru effort.

I think about, how do I move beyond this point so that it feels like the same movement? How do I extend this feeling of movement? I visualize the direction a muscle moves. 

## Pay attention to large distances in proportion to effort:

Pay attention to the distribution of feedback for a movement. Divide a movement into three parts: the beginning, middle, and end. Based on sensor feedback, do you expect the beginning to equal the middle and equal the end?

Although that might be the mental model for most people, the truth is very different. There is a tremendous amount of feedback for the first part, and the growing progressively less and less as effort increases. So in the bending of an arm, the first 70% of the distance belongs to the first part, because of the sensory richness. The middle part moves the arm only 20%. While the last part only moves 10%.

To put this another way, the feeling of effort is the inverse of the perceived feedback. By dividing effort equally into three stages, one gets a 70, 20, 10 distribution of the movement.

Previously, I paid attention to the smallest physical distance a movement can make in the beginning. Trying to match that sensation to a location on the body was not good enough. 

Now I am paying attention the phyisical distance traveled by the first stage of effort, and using that rich sensory feedback to locate the position.

This routine brings to focus the large movements for the first time. Movements such as bending a leg or an arm used to be incomprehensible. Because by only moving in small increments, the huge distance covered in larger movements meant that there was 20-30 small increments. There was no discernable pattern to how those small increments change. I now realize that the small increments was possible due to a combination of muscle movements and did no reflect that actual essential muscles used in a movement.

## Pay attention to the pattern of effort:

Pay attention to the pattern of effort for a movement. The pattern is the beginning of a movement is easy and provides an effortless feeling. Then it becomes harder to move. Finally, it is difficult. 

By matching this pattesrn of effort to the study of movement, I find that I can eliminate a lot of areas to look at because they do not match. The reason they do not match is probably because it was caused by two or more muscles moving at once rather than an essential muscle movement.

## Pay attention to the sensation of joints:

Bones and joints are good indicators of movements. Often movements are about rotating around a certain joints. Thinking about joints allows me to focus on the direction of a movement. Does the movement go forward or backward, left and right? or up and down? Certain movements that might easily be thought of a moving up and down, such as the straighting of the spine, might actually be a movement of a muscule pulling forward and backward in space, shifting the spine closer towards the front of the rib cage or farther away.

## Pay attention to the relaxation

Pay attention to the way the muscles feel when relaxing. There should be a tangible feeling of relaxation and not just a slow incremental change in position. This tangible feeling of relaxation allows one to filter out the feeling of the movement versus the noise of the other bone/skin/other muscle sensations.
