#My life is an endless series of cycles
### Cycle planning for the personal me

#Rekindle my love of art (4 weeks)
- Week 1: Get inspired. Go look at some awesome pictures, read up on some art courses, find something interesting and make sure it's HARD.
- Week 2: Start taking a class, or register for a membership, and paint/draw 1 picture that is very hard for you.
- Week 3: This is the tough week, go paint/create something similar to what you did before, redo this 2 more times.
- Week 4: Did you improve? was it challenging and fun? Can you think of any other interesting projects to do?

#Music for my soul (6 weeks)
*TBD* Task: do a spike, music teachers? piano youtube vids? Sell a piano?

#Programming for my brain (4 weeks)
- Week 1: The little lisper. Learn functional programming.
- Week 2: The little lisper part 2. Learn functional programming.
- Week 3: Hurray! You should've finished by now. Go look at functional programming in the practical world. Javascript ajax? maybe a bit of functional ruby? Watch videos
- Week 4: Take a deep breath and go back to some object oriented programming. Try doing some of the lisper exercises in normal ruby, go do a codeschool ruby course. Thoughts?
- Post mortem: Reflect? was this actually useful? do you see doing this in real life? Is this what studying programming should be?

#Mobile developer dammit!
*Note: I've tried this before, and it was fucking hard* 
- prep work: Preordered Big Nerd Ranch's book!
