# A collection of notes on painting

## The artifical feeling from learning about painting
I have always have had a sense of unease learning many of the painting theories. When I read about the anatomy, or light theory, or perspective theory of painting, I feel like there is simply too much information. Unlike science, the theories of painting seems like they lack that rootedness from being simply law derived from the faithful observation of nature. 

Painting theory seems too complicated, where as observing nature feels so simple.

## Measuring and accuracy - Test Dec 7 2013
I made two drawings of the ventilator hood. The first drawing starts with the largest shape I can make, and progressively divide it into small shapes. The second drawing starts with the smallest distances I can judge and slowly builds towards larger distances. 

The results are that starting small makes it easier to judge distances, and increases the overall accuracy. I feel that drawing accurately without mechnical aid involves two visual tasks. One is comparing two lengths that are both in the field of vision. The second task is to acclimatize one self with how large/small things are at this distance. In other words, I think the reason starting small works better is because smaller units more naturally resembles our innate abilities to acclimatize with looking at objects in a distance. I don't know if this acclimatization lasts for a long time, but as long as the viewer and the object's relationship is stable, then my theory suggests that starting small is better.
> What could have skewed the results of this test?
- The order of experiment. Because I started the "large to small" version first, I may have learned from the mistakes, and used the unconscious extra knowledge to make my second experient, the "small to large", better. In otherwords, there might be no difference that can be attributed to the method, but rather only because of learning.
- Another reason could be the forshortening of the paper. Try it on easel, with an immovable setup.

> What alternative theories could also have caused this same phenomenon
- When drawing geometric objects, paying attention to the smaller dimensions is easier because of the way these metalic, man-made objects are designed. There's an inherant influence from the designers/manufacturing methods of the product.
- Statistical chance. I am simply not experienced enough to be able to do two drawings and have only the measuring methods vary. Could be some other mental/dexterity factor.
