# A collection of notes on painting

## The artifical feeling from learning about painting
I have always have had a sense of unease learning many of the painting theories. When I read about the anatomy, or light theory, or perspective theory of painting, I feel like there is simply too much information. Unlike science, the theories of painting seems like they lack that rootedness from being simply law derived from the faithful observation of nature. 

Painting theory seems too complicated, where as observing nature feels so simple.

## Measuring and accuracy - Test Dec 7 2013
I made two drawings of the ventilator hood. The first drawing starts with the largest shape I can make, and progressively divide it into small shapes. The second drawing starts with the smallest distances I can judge and slowly builds towards larger distances. 

The results are that starting small makes it easier to judge distances, and increases the overall accuracy. I feel that drawing accurately without mechnical aid involves two visual tasks. One is comparing two lengths that are both in the field of vision. The second task is to acclimatize one self with how large/small things are at this distance. In other words, I think the reason starting small works better is because smaller units more naturally resembles our innate abilities to acclimatize with looking at objects in a distance. I don't know if this acclimatization lasts for a long time, but as long as the viewer and the object's relationship is stable, then my theory suggests that starting small is better.
> What could have skewed the results of this test?
- The order of experiment. Because I started the "large to small" version first, I may have learned from the mistakes, and used the unconscious extra knowledge to make my second experient, the "small to large", better. In otherwords, there might be no difference that can be attributed to the method, but rather only because of learning.
- Another reason could be the forshortening of the paper. Try it on easel, with an immovable setup.

> What alternative theories could also have caused this same phenomenon
- When drawing geometric objects, paying attention to the smaller dimensions is easier because of the way these metalic, man-made objects are designed. There's an inherant influence from the designers/manufacturing methods of the product.
- Statistical chance. I am simply not experienced enough to be able to do two drawings and have only the measuring methods vary. Could be some other mental/dexterity factor.

## Patterns of my art
When I examined my ability to paint from the lense of programming, I realize that it is a set of recurring patterns of behaviours. Here, I'd like to introduce these pattern, and hopefuly in time, I can refine them, vary them, and find something better.

####Composition

>"One third rule" - divide viewing area into thirds, and put something of interest on the 1/3 line.

>"Frame" - A frame defines the art. Frame off a section.

####Measuring/Accuracy

>"Large to small" - Draw the bounding lines of large shapes and subdivide into smaller shapes.

>"Small to large" - Start with small shapes and piece together into larger shapes.

>"Negative shapes"

>"Horizontal/vertical rules"
####Procedure

>"Measure then paint" - Plot the measurements first using whatever means. Once measurements are done, fill in the outlines with value/colour. 

>"Wash first, then solid colours" - Lay in a rough/faint wash of colours to set a base tone. Also can create more saturated colours than using tints.

>"Darkest darks, lightest lights" - Start by defining the extreme value ranges. This helps judging the colour range available from the medium. Then paint in the in between values"

>"Neutral grey, then extremes" - Start by laying in a neutral grey, from which one progressively grows darker/lighter. I suspect this is easier to judge value relationships.

>"Dark to light/ light to dark" - Same pattern, different starting point. 

>"Compare edges" - Sometimes an edge looks too sharp not because it is, but because it needs a sharper edge in the area for comparison. Do a sweep of edges and make adjustments.

>"value/colour then edge" - Fill in two areas with the right tone, then consider the blending between them.

>"colour distribution / light colour" - Plot the way the direct light and indirect light changes the hue of the colours. Usually finds the closest colour combination than can explain away most of the hue shifts. This way one does not have to think about major changes of colour mixing.

>Paint, debug, paint - Paint for a short period of time, step back, go thru the debug procedures, and paint again. The idea is to arrive at the correct answer thru iteration.

>"Poster" - create a tiny thumbnail, stating the general relationships of value/colour/light


#### Debugging

>"Reduce and remove detail"
Remove details from the trouble spot, and redraw.

>"Combine and refactor values into larger areas"
Blend the trouble spot together into a neutral average.
>> Squint - physically squit to reduce the value variations you see.

>"Recheck accuracy"
Check accuracy, and fix mistakes. Step away from the work and view in distance.

>"Check edges"
Check the relationships between the major edges and if they fall into the correct range. Soften/sharpen when needed.

>"Brush sweep / randomize" - derived from reduce and remove detail
Remove detail from the trouble spot and add the illusion of detail by randomly brushing with a splayed brush

#### Oil/acrylic paint medium

>"colour lay-in order" - Mixing paint only produces a certain range of values/saturations. Scrubbing paint onto white canvas, or solvent wash-in can create different effects. If you want to take advantage of it, the basic layin order should be: dry scrubbing -> solvent washin -> thin mixed colours (for detail) -> thick impasto

>"Edge sharpness order" - The edge, where two patches of colour connect, can range from very blended to sharp seperation. Blending in colours usually means sweeping a brush on the edge of two connected colours, while sharp edges is usually created by layering thicker impasto onto thinner paint. 

>"Thickness check" - Paint is difficult to shape when its thick. To accurately paint, it is necessary to layer thicker paint onto thinner paint. When the current thickness reaches a certain threshold, then it is necessary to remove the exisiting paint before making more changes.

>"Primary colours check, plan for secondary colours" - physical paint does not mix in an ideal way, similar looking starting colours can produce dramatically different neutrals/secondary colours. Examine the colour range provided by the current primaries and replace if necessary.

>"Break down colours into their mixes" - Treats the colours you see as paint mixures. It is easier to think about value/saturation shifts. In fact, the secret to good colour mixing might be to convert the tendency to think in absolute values into thinking in the model of the paint. Every addition of paint creates both a value, hue, and saturation change.
